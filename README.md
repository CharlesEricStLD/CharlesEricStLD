**About me**  
My passion for technology started early, from tinkering with the family computer to pursuing a career in web development. I've been fortunate to work in diverse roles, including as an outdoor guide and tech enthusiast, which eventually led me to dive fully into FullStack development. I thrive on solving problems with creative, reusable code and enjoy building projects that blend functionality with user-friendly design.

From my work on cross-country platforms tracking trail conditions and volunteer sign-ups, to enhancing online farm purchasing experiences, I constantly seek out new challenges and learning opportunities. Currently, I‚Äôm expanding my expertise in C#, SQL, and server management while staying committed to high-quality development.

Whether collaborating with teams or tackling projects on my own, I focus on making a lasting impact through efficient and maintainable solutions. Let's connect and collaborate‚ÄîI'm always eager to grow, share knowledge, and create something meaningful.
