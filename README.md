<br>🔭 I’m currently working on a full-stack platform dedicated to providing real-time snow conditions for all cross-country ski centers in Quebec. This centralized solution streamlines the process of finding updates, offering users quick access to the latest conditions for their favorite spots, with features like log into their profile and the ability to create favorites.
<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with mastering advanced TypeScript and integrating microservices.<br>🌱 I’m currently learning C#, server management, SQL, and PHP.<br>💬 Ask me about transitioning from outdoor guide to tech and the balance between functionality and maintainability in development.<br>⚡ Fun fact: I’ve worked in environments ranging from 40°C to -40°C!<br>```

### About me  
My passion for technology started early, from tinkering with the family computer to pursuing a career in web development. I've been fortunate to work in diverse roles, including as an outdoor guide and tech enthusiast, which eventually led me to dive fully into FullStack development. I thrive on solving problems with creative, reusable code and enjoy building projects that blend functionality with user-friendly design.

From my work on cross-country platforms tracking trail conditions and volunteer sign-ups, to enhancing online farm purchasing experiences, I constantly seek out new challenges and learning opportunities. Currently, I’m expanding my expertise in C#, SQL, and server management while staying committed to high-quality development.

Whether collaborating with teams or tackling projects on my own, I focus on making a lasting impact through efficient and maintainable solutions. Let's connect and collaborate—I'm always eager to grow, share knowledge, and create something meaningful.
